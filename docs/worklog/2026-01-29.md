## Evening Session

### Accomplished
- Completed psd3→hylograph rename commits across all repos (13 repos total)
- Created 3 new GitHub repos for libraries without remotes (graph, d3-kernel, showcase-shell)
- Dead code audit: removed PSD3.purs, .legacy files from selection library
- Scaffolded hylograph.net site with logo curtain intro + docs quadrant
- Split site responsibilities: polyglot = showcases, hylograph.net = docs
- Removed docs quadrant from polyglot website, replaced with link

### Explored But Not Pursued
- Full dead code removal from website (TreeAPI, old AST examples) - deferred to tomorrow
- The `_archived` directories in website are actually still imported - left alone for now

### Decisions Made
- hylograph.net = documentation home, polyglot = showcase manifesto
- Library pages on hylograph.net will be README.md → HTML (single source of truth)
- Logo curtain timing: 1.2s display, 0.6s fade, logo sized to match one quadrant

### Next Session Setup
- Delete suspected dead code (old AST, TreeAPI) and see what breaks
- Port needed code to HATS or archive
- Clean up and redo documentation once library is stable

## Late Night: Site Explorer Analysis

Used new Site Explorer tool (halogen-spider) to identify unreachable routes. Analysis of 40 unreachable routes:

### DELETE (13 routes) - Clear cruft
- AnimatedAttrTest, GUPAnimatedTest - Archived (.bak files)
- ForceConfigPOC, ForceConfigV2Test - Superseded by SimpleForceGraph
- LesMisGUP (6 variants) - All redirect to Home, archived series

### KEEP (6 routes) - Working exemplars
- GeneralUpdatePattern - Classic GUP showcase
- HATSTransitionTest - Modern HATS demo
- MermaidTreeDemo - Interpreter pattern
- SPLOMHATS - HATS + coordinated brush
- TreeAPI - Core API exemplar
- UpdateJoinDemo - UpdateNestedJoin pattern

### PORT to HATS (4 routes) - Worth modernizing
- PieDonutDemo - Simple, good starter port
- SPLOM - Brush interaction patterns
- ChartBuilder - Interactive builder concept
- SimpleTreeBuilder - Emmet notation

### MAYBE (7 routes) - Evaluate during cleanup
- ForcePlaygroundWASM - WASM backend story?
- GUPDebug, SankeyDebug - Docs/learning value?
- SimpleChimera - ConditionalRender demo
- TreeBuilder2/3 - Consolidate?
- VizMatrix - Type matrix demo

### Tomorrow's Plan
1. Delete the 13 DELETE routes
2. Verify KEEP routes still work
3. Port PieDonutDemo (simplest) to validate HATS workflow
4. Decide MAYBE routes based on what breaks

### Tool Note
Site Explorer (halogen-spider) becoming another showcase - partner to Code Explorer.
Analyzes Halogen route definitions vs actual navigation graph.
