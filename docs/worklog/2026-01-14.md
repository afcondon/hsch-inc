## TreeBuilder3 Explanatory Demo Redesign (continued)

### Accomplished
- **Horizontal type cards**: Changed from vertical layout to horizontal (name left, fields right) for more compact display
- **Output section below AST**: Moved viz output from inside main SVG to dedicated "Step 4" section below the AST diagram
- **Larger AST tree**: Reduced SVG viewBox from 1920x1080 to 700x450 so tree appears bigger
- **Above-fold layout**: Fixed main layout height to 480px so output section visible on laptops
- **Code watermark positioning**: Moved further down and left to avoid overlap with SVG cards

### Technical Details
- All `renderInline*` functions now target `#tree-builder3-output` div and create their own SVG wrapper
- Output section always visible with header showing selected dataset name
- SVG card positions unchanged in coordinate terms but appear larger due to smaller viewBox

### Next Session
- Polish the actual visualizations (chess, scatter, bubble, tree, GUP)
- Make dataviz "really pretty" per user request
- Consider hiding/shrinking SVG cards if they're too prominent

### Commit
78689a1 TreeBuilder3 redesign: horizontal type cards, output section below AST

## PSD3-Graph Mini-Site: "The Honeycomb" Puzzle Game

### Accomplished
- **Designed novel graph puzzle game** - "The Alignment" / "The Honeycomb"
- **Core mechanic**: 6 hexagonal graphs, each with independent force simulation. Toggle an edge in one graph → toggles in all six (XOR). Goal: find configuration where all paths connect.
- **Rubik's cube generation**: Start from solved state, scramble N random toggles. Guarantees solvability.
- **Circle of Fifths threading**: 8 nodes (C,G,D,A,E,B,F#,C#), paths chain through musical keys. Easter egg for music nerds.

### Prototypes Created
- `psd3-astar-demo/puzzle.html` - First prototype (4 octagons, Byrne's Euclid style, single graph with 4 algorithmic views)
- `psd3-astar-demo/honeycomb.html` - JS prototype of full 6-hex shared-toggle mechanic (click broken due to animation loop DOM rebuilding)
- `psd3-astar-demo/src/Honeycomb/Types.purs` - PureScript types scaffolded

### Visual Design
- **Byrne's Euclid palette**: warm cream (#f5f0e6), rust red, slate blue, ochre, dark outlines
- Hexagon borders indicate path status (green=connected, red=disconnected)
- Serif typography (Palatino), italic labels, flat colors - distinguished "house style"

### Technical Validation: PASSED
- **6 concurrent force engines work!** - Tested with `MultiEngineTest.purs`
- Each simulation: 8 nodes, center force + manyBody force
- 10 ticks across all 6 simulations completed successfully
- No library modifications needed

### Key Insight
This demo differentiates psd3-graph from D3/GraphViz: we're *computing* with graphs (A*, connected components, etc), not just *drawing* them. Real typed graph algorithms, not just layout.

### Files
- `HONEYCOMB-NOTES.md` - Full design document

### Next Session
- Port to Halogen + psd3-simulation + psd3-graph
- Validate 6-engine performance
- Fix interaction (Halogen virtual DOM won't have the animation loop issue)
