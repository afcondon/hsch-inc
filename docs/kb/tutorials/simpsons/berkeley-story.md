In 1973, the University of California-Berkeley was sued for sex discrimination. The numbers looked pretty incriminating: the graduate schools had just accepted *44%* of male applicants but only *35%* of female applicants. When researchers looked at the evidence, though, they uncovered something surprising:

It was a textbook case of Simpson's paradox.

## What is Simpson's paradox?

Every Simpson's paradox involves at least three variables:

1. the explained
2. the observed explanatory
3. the lurking explanatory

If the effect of the observed explanatory variable on the explained variable changes directions when you account for the lurking explanatory variable, you've got a Simpson's Paradox.

For example, to the right, x appears to have a negative effect on y, but the opposite is true when you account for color. y is the explained variable, x the observed explanatory variable, and color the lurking explanatory variable.
